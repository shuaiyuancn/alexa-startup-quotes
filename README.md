A toy project for Amazon Alexa. When the skill is invoked, it returns a random quote from a selection of 101. These quotes are obtained from [onboardly](http://onboardly.com/content-marketing/101-kickass-startup-quotes/).

`lambda.py` contains the python code for the skill's backend. It is meant to be used as a AWS Lambda function.

Follow [this guide](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/getting-started-guide) to create an Alexa skill.

This project has already been registered as [an Alexa skill](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shuai-Yuan-StartupQuotes/dp/B073XRH1S7).
